# BookFlow

Welcome to BookFlow, a comprehensive library application built using Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework!

## Description

Excited to announce that I've embarked on a hobby project called BookFlow, where I'll be diving into the world of Quarkus! ðŸš€ðŸ“š As someone who is new to Quarkus, I'm eager to explore its capabilities. The project is in its early stages, and I'm aiming to build a comprehensive library application, covering everything from basic book management  to advanced features like ordering and online rentals.

My goal with this project is to create a well-structured reference work that can serve as a helpful resource for anyone interested in diving into Quarkus projects in the future. I'm excited to learn and grow throughout this journey, and I'll be sharing my progress and insights on GitHub.

If you're interested in Quarkus or simply want to follow along and provide support, I'd be thrilled to have you join me. Stay tuned for updates!
